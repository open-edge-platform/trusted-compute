# Trusted Compute

## Overview
Trusted Compute is a set of software defined security extensions that utilize hardware security capabilities of the Edge Node within the Open Edge Manageability Framework.

A user can select and deploy trusted compute extensions on a node to achieve higher security assurances for their workloads. This extension enhances edge node protection through:

- **Continuous Monitoring** &
- **Workload Protection through Isolated Execution**
