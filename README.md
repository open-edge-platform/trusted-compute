## Overview
Trusted Compute is an execution framework at the edge that provides isolated execution of workloads and platform abstraction for hardware-based security technologies following thwith following objectives.
1) **Continuous Monitoring:** Ensure the integrity of platform firmware, OS kernel, critical system components, and runtime environment through ongoing measurement and attestation.
2) **Isolated Execution:** Securely execute workloads to prevent unauthorized access or interference, and protect the trusted host from the workloads.
